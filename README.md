# AnimAI

AI-enabled motion recognition and animation generation.

## Goal
Use Artificial Intelligence paradigms to analyze body movement given video input.

Secondarily, generate an animated model for further use-cases.

## Use-Cases
### Sports
Analytics of technique and compensation strategies for different muscle groups given movement changes per exersice repetition.\
